# cyd-esp-unifi-touch
 An Arduino-based project for the CYD ESP32 touchscreen that connects to the UniFi Controller API to display real-time client and switch information.
# CYD ESP UniFi Touchscreen Network Mapper

> **Touchscreen UniFi Network Port Mapper for CYD ESP32** – Instantly see which switch port and patch panel a UniFi client is connected to, right from a handheld touchscreen.

## 📖 Overview

This Arduino-based project turns a **CYD ESP32 touchscreen** into a live UniFi network mapping tool. It connects to the UniFi Controller API and displays:

- **Client connection details** – which switch port each client is plugged into  
- **Patch panel mapping** – instantly locate cables  
- **Switch information** – quick access for troubleshooting and network tracing  

Perfect for **IT closets, data centers, and field techs**, this device eliminates the guesswork of tracing cables and speeds up network troubleshooting.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time UniFi API integration  
- Touch-friendly UI (CYD ESP32 + TFT_eSPI + XPT2046)  
- Color-coded, easy-to-read interface  
- Simple Wi-Fi and API setup  
- Standalone — no PC required

## ⚙️ User Configuration

Before compiling, update these values in the `.ino` file:

```cpp
// ——— USER CONFIGURATION —————————————
const char* rackName = "Rack Number";    // Friendly name for display
const uint8_t UI_ROTATION = 1;           // 1 = USB right, 3 = USB left
const char* ssid = "WIFINAME";           // Wi-Fi SSID
const char* password = "WIFIPASS";       // Wi-Fi password
const char* apiKey = "APIKEY";           // UniFi API key
const char* host = "192.168.2.1";        // UniFi Gateway IP
const char* siteId = "default";          // UniFi site ID
```
